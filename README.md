This is the second dataset analyzed with Python. 
INTRODUCTION
Real-world data rarely comes clean. I will be using Python and its libraries like pandas to gather data from various sources and different formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it, a process called Data Wrangling. I also documented the wrangling process and displayed them through analyses and visualizations using Python and its libraries.

The dataset that I will be wrangling, analyzing and visualizing is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.
